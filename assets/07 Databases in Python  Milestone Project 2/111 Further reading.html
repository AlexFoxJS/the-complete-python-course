<p>There's always more to learn, so I wanted to give you a few resources in case you want to dive deeper into the topic of errors and error handling in Python.</p>

<p>Here's a few great or interesting resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Python with Context Managers</a>, another Jeff Knupp post. It gets a bit advanced at the end, but it's really good up to halfway through. Read half and then continue after completing more of the course!</li><li><a href="http://eigenhombre.com/introduction-to-context-managers-in-python.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Introduction to Context Managers in Python</a>, a nice read to review context managers as we've looked at in this section. Worth a look!</li><li><a href="http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-autoincrement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SQLite AUTOINCREMENT : Why You Should Avoid Using It</a>, we didn't talk about AUTOINCREMENT in SQLite, but it is a frequent question amongst my students. Here's why AUTOINCREMENT can be a bad choice in SQLite.</li></ul><p>Kind regards,<br></p><p>Jose</p></p>
