<v ->Welcome to section seven.</v>

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,560
In this section, we're going to introduce a key concept

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,040
in programming and I think a very useful one

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,300
which is databases.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,580
I'm sure you already know what a database is,

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,810
you know, a store of data,

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,900
but there are various ways

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,860
in which databases can be organised

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,810
and there are various ways

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,720
in which we can interact with them.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,790 line:15% 
What we're gonna look at in this video

12
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,010 line:15% 
is an extremely popular way.

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,950
This is how IOS and Android use databases, for example,

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,690
and it's one of the ways that Python recommends

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,090
for starting up with databases.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,360
We're going to look at a database system called SQLite

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,640
which is sort of a low-scale brother of MySQL,

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,690
a very popular database system.

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,830
One of the great things about SQLite is that it's very small

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,690
so it can frequently be embedded

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,000
in places like mobile phones.

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,830
In addition, it's very fast, very easy to get started

23
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,400
with it, and it does everything you need.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,330
In this video, we're going to learn about that

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,330
and also about using SQL, a special language used

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,700
to interact with databases,

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,090
so that our applications can gain this extra power.

28
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,640
I'll see you in the next video.
