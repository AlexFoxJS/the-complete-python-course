<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,130
I'm sure that you can now use databases

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,100
from within your Python programmes

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,710
and SQLite is a great way of getting started with it.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,500
In addition, SQLite is pretty powerful.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
It's a very fast way of reading from a database

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,060
although it can, of course, lack

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,930
when you have a lot of people wanting

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,630
to write to your database at once.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,160
Nonetheless, SQLite is very used

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,200
throughout the entire Python ecosystem

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,450
and that's why it comes as standard

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,160
when you instal Python, the SQLite three module.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,890
I'm sure you've learned a lot about databases

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,310
in this section so let's move over to the next one

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,460
and I'll see you there.
