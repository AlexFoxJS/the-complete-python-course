<v ->Welcome to section eight.</v>

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,670
In this section, which is gonna be a short one,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,140
we're just going to add some more functionality

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,890
to the project we built in the last section.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,030
By adding type painting, we can make it more obvious

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,960
what functions are doing, what values they're expecting,

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,010
and what values they're getting back.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,690
Overall it's a great technique to do in your programmes.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,650
Type painting in Python is really simple.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,410
We're gonna go through some of the best practises

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,510
in that section so that you can add it

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,580
to your own programmes as well.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,130
I'll see you in the next video.
