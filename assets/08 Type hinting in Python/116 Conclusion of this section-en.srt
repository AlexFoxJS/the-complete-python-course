<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,990
You saw me just a few minutes ago introducing this section,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,540
but hopefully type painting is simple

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,970
and easy to understand.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,980
Using type painting means that your functions

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,900
can more easily tell us what they expect,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,460
and what they give back, and that can be really useful

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,930
especially as your programmes grow in size.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,600
That's it for this section, though,

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,300
so I'll see you in the next video.
