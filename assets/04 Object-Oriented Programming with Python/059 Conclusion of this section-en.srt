<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of this section.</v>

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,580
Object oriented programming can be quite tricky,

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,100
particularly if you've only just started.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,540
Sometimes it can be confusing

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,290
or it can take awhile to click.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,700
Don't be too worried if not everything is crystal clear

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,340
at the moment, just make sure you don't copy code.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,720
Write it all out.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,770
And if you have any questions, ask in the course Q&amp;A,

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,270
and we'll be glad to help you.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,750
In the next section, we're going to look at some more Python

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,000
so don't go anywhere, and I'll see you there.
