<p>This is my solution to the coding exercise. Again, it may be slightly different from yours!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"># We have a class called Club, and it is initialized like this (no need to change):
class Club:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.players = []

    # optional
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.players)

    # define a method that allows us to access the i-th player in the club directly via indexing.
    # for example, if some_club is an object of Club class,
    # we can access the i-th player in some_club like this (you may assume i is always valid):
    # some_club[i]
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.players[i]

    # define a method that returns a string representation of this object,
    # which can be used to recreate this object.
    # The return value should be in such format (beware of the spacing):
    # Club {club_name}: {list_of_players}
    # the club_name and list_of_players should be replaced by the according value of current object
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Club {}: {}'.format(self.name, self.players)

    # define a method that returns a readable string representation of this object for the user.
    # The return value should be in such format (beware of the spacing):
    # Club {club_name} with {count_of_players} players
    # the club_name and count_of_players should be replaced by the according value of current object
    def __str__(self):
        return 'Club {} with {} players'.format(self.name, len(self))

# You only need to finish the method, we will take care of the object creation and call those methods for you!</pre>

<p>Let me know how you got on!</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>
