<v ->Welcome to section four.</v>

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,950
A lot of beginners struggle with what we're going to cover

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,270
in this section, which is object-oriented programming.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,090
The way we've constructed this course,

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,100
I'm sure you're not gonna have any difficulties whatsoever

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,210
in understanding what object-oriented programming is about

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,580
and also how to use it in Python.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,560
Object-oriented programming is going to allow our programmes

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,490
to start talking about things that happen in the real world,

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,410
after all programming is a tool to convert data

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,800
from the real world into something we can use in programmes.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,660
Object-oriented programming is essential for us,

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,110
the programmers, to understand more about how that happens.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,660
I'll see you in the next video.
