00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,880
<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,210
Files is an extremely useful thing in Python

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,550
and in any programming language.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,810
Not everybody uses databases yet,

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,290
even though they are becoming more and more popular,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,190
and often you'll want to share files with your users

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,770
or with other stakeholders in your programme,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,500
so it can be really useful to write things to a file.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,610
Not only for saving the status of your programme,

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,070
but also to share information, maybe to send it

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,590
over the internet as we will look at later on,

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,980
and to do a number of other things.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,780
Files are very important for that reason,

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,830
so hopefully now you are more comfortable

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,610
in writing files with Python.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,620
In addition, often we want to read from files

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,330
to extract data,

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,930
to understand what other programmes are giving us,

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,780
so I hope you are confident doing that now as well.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,480
If you have any problems, of course,

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,200
please ask in the course Q and A,

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,050
and we'll be more than happy to help.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,940
With that said, let's move over to the next section.

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,020
I'll see you there.
