<v ->Welcome to section six.</v>

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
In section six, we're going to start adding

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,570
some more complexity into our programmes

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,010
and make them able to save data permanently.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,766
The programmes we've been creating so far

6
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:17,050
have started and they've done something,

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,740
and at the end, we've lost all the context

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,040
of what happened in the programme.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,270
That's not so useful in many cases.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,420
Often, you want your programmes to remember

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,520
what happened the last time you ran them.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,340
For example, if you're watching a movie,

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,020
you then want it to remember where you left off.

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,880
And if you're registering for a website,

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,280
you normally want it to remember you

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,140
the next time you come back.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,450
For this, we need to be able to store data in places,

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,000
and in this section, we're going to look

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,590
at storing data inside files.

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,120
Later on, we'll look at databases, so don't worry.

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,090
That is still to come.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,840
Let's move on to the next video, so I'll see you there.
