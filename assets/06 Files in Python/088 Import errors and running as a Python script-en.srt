00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
<v Jose>Hi, welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,440
In this video, we're going to look at:

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,930
what is an import error, and also how you can run some

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,520
code in a file, only when the file is ran as a script

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,150
and not as a module.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,710
It's very straight forward.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,880
The import errors, though, are not so easy.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,990
Let's have a look at an import error.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,650
We've got app importing file operations,

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,970
file operations importing find,

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,670
and find's not importing anything.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,960
Let's make find import file operations.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,330
So let's do this, let's ask it to go into file operations

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,050
and import something specific.

15
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,290
Let's run app.py, let's see what happens.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,800
Now we get an import error because what's happening

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,410
is app is importing utils.common.file_operations,

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,440
this is importing utils.find,

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,540
and now utils.find is importing utils.common.file_operations

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,660
which is already in the imported modules.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,140
And Python knows about this, it keeps a global dictionary

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,710
of modules that have been imported already,

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,200
and as we try to access something in it,

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,180
it says, oh wait, actually, when I try to go

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,080
to this module to extract this function here,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,840
I can't do that because when I run that,

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,580
it asks me to go back here, so that doesn't work.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,370
Notice however, that if you ask it not to import

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,530
a particular thing, but just to execute the module,

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,530
like if you do import utils.common.file_operations,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,340
it is okay with this because it sees

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,640
that its already imported this module,

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,360
therefore, nothing to do.

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,540
It just ignores it, because its already been imported

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,800
in the past, like this.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,670
So that's a pretty important thing to know.

37
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,090
If your module's already imported,

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,310
you can import it again the same way,

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,840
but if your module's already imported,

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,340
and you want to access something specific in it,

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,610
Python is going to then go and look into that module again,

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,680
and it's going to give you an error

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,150
because it's going to go back and forth.

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,550
This is called a circular import,

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,200
it's not such a good thing to do.

46
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,480
Now, in some cases, a completely separate topic,

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,190
you'll want some code to run,

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,600
for example, let's go to the find function.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,590
You'll want some code to run only when

50
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,520
you execute find.py.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,800
So if you run find.py, you want some code to run,

52
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,410
and you can do that.

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,040
By the way, I'm going to delete this import there

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,570
because it works, but it's a circular import,

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,310
and I don't like that.

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,590
So if we were to run find.py,

57
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,360
let's say we wanna test out our finding function.

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
So we'd say, find_in Rolf, Jose, and Jen,

59
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,870
and what we're looking is lambda x,

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,360
yeah, that's it.

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,590
We're gonna just return x, and the expected is, Jose.

62
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,090
So what's gonna happen is, this list becomes the iterable

63
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,010
lambda x returns x, which returns every element

64
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,130
as we go through them,

65
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,580
and Jose is the value we're looking for.

66
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,380
So for i in iterable, goes over each element.

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,470
i becomes Rolf, then it becomes Jose, then it becomes Jen,

68
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,860
we run the finder function, which just gives

69
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,330
us the value that's Rolf, Jose, or Jen,

70
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,410
and we check that it's equal to the expected value,

71
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,860
which in this case is Jose.

72
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,730
i would return it if it's fact.

73
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,060
So if we run the find.py file,

74
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,180
we get Jose out, which is good.

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,130
But notice how find.py is imported by file operations.

76
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,170
File operations is imported by app.

77
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,820
So if we run app, we also get Jose,

78
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,560
because find was executed by the import

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,393
and it ran this code.

80
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:16,420
We don't want that.

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,820
Because this is only for testing the module.

82
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,760
We only want to run this code if we physically

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,610
right-click the module and run it.

84
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,670
If we run it as a script.

85
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,380
And we can do that with an f statement.

86
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,350
Of course, what's gonna be in our f statement?

87
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,470
We wanna check whether the name is main.

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,070
Go and implement it yourselves.

89
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm sure you got that if name is main, run this.

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,940
Pretty straight forward stuff.

91
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,600
Of course, you have to realise that

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,780
this is something you can do.

93
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,470
After all, these are just a variable.

94
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,290
This is just a variable, and this is just a string.

95
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,790
So you can check whether they are equal,

96
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,640
and run something if they are.

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,630
Now when you run find.py, you get Jose.

98
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,120
When you run app.py, you don't because it didn't run

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,090
as a script.

100
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,570
The name was not main.

101
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,160
The name was utils.find.

102
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,350
That's it for this video.

103
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,780
I wanted just to show you a bit more about importing,

104
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,420
how you can run something only when you run it as a script,

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,450
and also how you can cause import errors,

106
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,710
and of course, that you should avoid import errors.

107
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,410
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you on the next one.
