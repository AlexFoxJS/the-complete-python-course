00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,840
<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of a section.</v>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,320
In this section, we looked at a number of tools

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,530
you can use throughout all your projects,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,040
such as timing your code, using regular expressions,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,760
and much more.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,460
Particularly the issue of dates and times

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,040
can be a thorny one, and it can be difficult to understand.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,150
As you work more with it, I'm sure it will become clearer.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,790
That's it for this section though,

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,390
so I'll see you on the next one.
