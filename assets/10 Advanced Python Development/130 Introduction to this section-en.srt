<v ->Welcome to Section 10.</v>

00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,733
In this section,

3
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:04,790
we're going to look at some more

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,220
advanced Python development concepts.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,430
Not many courses get into such advanced topics,

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,540
but we're going to look here

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,710
at some bit in collections.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,100
Unlike the list or tuple,

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,310
these are useful in a smaller,

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,240
but very important, set of scenarios.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,310
We'll be using them throughout the course.

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,920
We're also going to look at things like dates and times,

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,470
regular expressions,

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,710
timing your code,

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,180
and much more.

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,500
This section is going to give you a lot of tools

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,400
that you can then use in your own project.

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,950
I'll see you in the next video.
