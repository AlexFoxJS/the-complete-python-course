<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of a section.</v>

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,460
Advanced object oriented programming

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,010
can sometimes have negative connotations,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,190
particularly if we're talking about Java,

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,780
known for having many many interfaces,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,490
classes, and all sorts of things.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,070
Python is much simpler than that, and I quite like it.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,860
But there are still some advanced topics that you can use

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,950
like ABCs and interfaces.

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,530
And the way that they're built in Python,

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,130
I think makes a bit more sense.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,760
Hopefully you've enjoyed this section,

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,410
and I'll see you on the next one.
