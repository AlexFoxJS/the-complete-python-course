<v ->Welcome to this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,983
We're going to look

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:06,310
at some more advanced object-oriented programming

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,810
in this section, including Python's popular ABCs,

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,250
as well as a number of other things.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,950
This section is just going to give you a few more tools

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,310
that you can use when you're developing

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,760
a larger and more complex application,

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,900
particularly in the topic of ABCs,

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,470
which I know you don't know what I mean yet,

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,290
but we will cover them soon.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,370
This is a topic that's very infrequently understood.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,370
So we're going to try to dispel any myths

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,920
and help you through them.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,470
I'll see you on the next video.
