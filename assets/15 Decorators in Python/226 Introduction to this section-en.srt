00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,110
In this section we're going to look

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,820
at decorators in Python.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,020
Decorators are just higher-order functions

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,320
which return a function.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,060
As you know, higher-order functions

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,950
are functions that take in a function as an argument.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,690
And a special property of decorators

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,810
is that they must return a function as well.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,050
These are used for all sorts of things.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,910
Actually, Python has some special syntax

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,640
that allows us to use decorators

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,200
in a very easy to read manner.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,090
If you've got no idea why you might want

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,180
to use a decorator, watch on.

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,370
I'm going to give you a few examples that are really useful.

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,920
I'll see you on the next video.
