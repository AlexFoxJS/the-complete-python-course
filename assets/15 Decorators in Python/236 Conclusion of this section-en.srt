<v ->Congratulations on finishing this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,330
I'm sure that decorators now make a bit more sense,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,910
but what's most important is

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,830
that you have this essential tool in your arsenal now.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,330
There'll be a number of situations

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,590
as you develop your Python programmes

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,210
where you'll encounter a situation that is perfect

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,070
for a decorator and in those cases,

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,930
now I'm confident you'll be able to come up

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,820
with a great solution using these decorators

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,800
and the syntax we've covered in these videos.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,590
If you did not know about this,

13
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,250
it could be really difficult to come up with a nice,

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,360
readable solution.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,830
So, congratulations again on finishing this section.

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,280
I'll see you on the next one.
