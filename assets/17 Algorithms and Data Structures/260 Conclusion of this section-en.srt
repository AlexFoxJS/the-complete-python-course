<v ->Congratulations on finishing this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,530
Algorithms and data structures is a complicated topic

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,420
and one that frequently pops up

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,091
in interviews and coding challenges.

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:12,860
Hopefully this section has helped you

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,460
understand a bit more about how

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,170
these algorithms and data structures work

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,430
in Python and in other languages.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,970
I'll see you on the next section.
