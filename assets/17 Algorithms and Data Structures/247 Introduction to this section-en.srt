<v ->Welcome to this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,340
In this section, we're going to look at some more advanced

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,330
computer science topics like algorithms and data structures.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,620
We'll cover some data structures and then we'll also

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,440
be building our own, an advanced version of a binary tree.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,790
Binary trees can be extremely useful in a number

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,810
of scenarios, but particularly when you want to quickly

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,230
access data that is already sorted.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,310
For example, it is commonly used in databases.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,340
So with that said, I'll see you on the next video.
