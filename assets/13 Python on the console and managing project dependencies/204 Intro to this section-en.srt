<v ->Welcome back.</v>

00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,040
In this section, we're going to look

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,130
at how you can run your Python programmes

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,200
without depending on PyCharm.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,910
Using PyCharm is great.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,060
It's a great tool, very simple,

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,730
but many times you'll want to run your Python programmes

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,600
in a server on the internet, for example,

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,430
or you may want to share them with somebody else

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,950
who doesn't have PyCharm.

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,710
And in those cases, it can be useful to know

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,630
how to run your applications without using it.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,180
In addition, we're also going to look

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,060
at how to structure your projects and their dependencies,

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,720
any libraries you need

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,270
so that it's a bit simpler to work

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,880
when you're doing many projects at once.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,430
I'll see you on the next video.
