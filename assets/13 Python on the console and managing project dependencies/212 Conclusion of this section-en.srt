<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,180
In this section we looked at how

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,750
to run your Python programmes outside of any tools,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,660
and we also looked at a couple other things

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,980
that you can use to structure your project

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,100
and independencies better.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,830
Hopefully you enjoyed this section.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,290
I'm sure it's going to be really useful

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,890
as you develop your own project.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,010
With that said, I'll see you on the next one.
