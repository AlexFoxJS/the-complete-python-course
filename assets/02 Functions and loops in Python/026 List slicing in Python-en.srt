00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,570
<v Instructor>Hi and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,790
In this video I wanted to tell you about list slicing.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,460
Let's have a list of my friends,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,620
which are just strings.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,110
And let's say I wanted to get friends,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,110
from two 'til four.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,040
Remember, this is zero, one, two, three and four.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,720
So, two 'til four should be Anna to Mary.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,320
But normally in Python the last one is not included,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,730
so two 'til four is actually Anna and Charlie.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,710
The way we do that, is instead of accessing friends two

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,740
and then adding it to friends three,

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,990
which would be an option,

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,300
we can do this, friends two until four.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,950
Four is not included, so that gives us two and three.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,910
Okay?

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,800
List slicing is really useful in many scenarios,

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,950
because it's a way to construct a new list.

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,350
It's a very Pythonic way at that.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
Now the first number here, as you know,

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,070
is the starting index of the slice.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,250
That's two, and four is the ending index of the slice,

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,100
that's four.

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,590
But we can also use negative numbers,

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,070
which means we start counting from the end.

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,920
For example,

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,860
let me print, friends minus one.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,570
You can always do this at any point,

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,170
whenever you want to get the last element of a list.

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,250
See, that was Mary.

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,950
Friends minus one is Mary,

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,890
because it starts counting at the very end.

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,190
Now, the normal thing

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,500
would be to say this is minus zero, right?

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
Because if Rolf is zero,

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,240
and that's the first element,

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,260
surely the last element should be minus zero.

38
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,610
But of course minus zero's not a number,

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,260
so the next best thing is minus one.

40
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,650
So minus one gives you the last element,

41
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,440
one gives you the second element.

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,020
So you can do minus one up until minus three, for example.

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,080
But sadly, this is not really something you can do.

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
You'd think that minus one 'til minus three

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,830
would somehow give you this reverse list here of.

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,760
And Mary and Charlie, right?

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,740
Minus three being Anna, and not being included.

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,390
But Python doesn't quite like that,

49
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,700
so these actually have to be reversed.

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,570
So you always have to go left to right in your list.

51
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,950
Minus three being Anna, minus one being Mary.

52
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,910
Okay, and again you get Anna and Charlie,

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,780
because the last index here is not included.

54
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,760
So you get minus three and minus two.

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,910
If we wanted to get our last three friends,

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,100
which is a very popular operation,

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,150
just the last three,

58
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,110
or maybe the top two or something like that,

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,260
you can print friends, and then minus three,

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,070
which would give you Anna, a colon,

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,570
and that's it, nothing else.

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,780
And that says minus three up until and including

63
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,030
the very end of the list.

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,040
So that gives you Anna, Charlie and Mary.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,410
Really useful stuff.

66
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,120
But particularly useful is when you want to get,

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,960
for example, your top two friends.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,500
Well you can do that.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,620
Starting at zero, up to index number two, not including.

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,540
So that gives you zero and one.

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,580
And again you get Rolf and Jose.

72
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,690
You can also do, friends

73
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,370
minus two, like so.

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,870 line:15% 
So what's that gonna give you?

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,790 line:15% 
Hopefully you got that correct.

76
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,170
It's gonna start at zero, that's Rolf.

77
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,890
And it's gonna go all the way up to index minus two,

78
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,060
which is Charlie,

79
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,600
remember, minus one is Mary, minus two is Charlie.

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,910
This is not gonna be included,

81
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,660
so it's gonna give you these three.

82
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,930
And there you go.

83
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,060
This can be a pretty confusing way of thinking about things,

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,620
but it can be really useful.

85
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,480
For example, imagine we're interacting with a list,

86
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,150
like a table, and the first thing in the table

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,500
is gonna be the column names,

88
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,980
and everything else in the table is gonna be data.

89
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,020
Maybe we'll want to get

90
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,210
all the data excluding the table names.

91
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,040
Then we can do, my table one, colon.

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,830
That gives us index to one onwards, until the very end.

93
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,930
Presumably index zero would be the table headers.

94
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,440
And I use that example,

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,940
not because I want to confuse you

96
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,510
talking about tables all of a sudden,

97
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,590
but because we're actually going to use that example

98
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,120
later on in the course.

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,740
So this is why list slicing is introduced here.

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,030
Just want you to know, this is something you can do,

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,660
and we will be using it later on,

102
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,330
and we'll be able to refresh our memory on it.

103
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,710
Anyway, that's it for this video.

104
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,290
Pre-Pythonic way of constructing new lists.

105
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,870
And so remember you can use this

106
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,420
whenever you want a part of a list or something like that.

107
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,590
Anyway, that's it for this video.

108
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll see you on the next one.
