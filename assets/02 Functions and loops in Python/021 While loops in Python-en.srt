00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,460
<v Instructor>Hi and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,240
In this video we're gonna look at the while loop.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,290
The while loop and the any loop allows us

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,880
to run something multiple times.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,580
Okay, why might you want to run something many times?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,970
For example, imagine you have a thermometer, an oven,

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,510
and you want to continuously check the temperature

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,440
of the oven, turn the oven on

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,560
if the temperature is under some sort of amount,

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,820
or turn the oven off if the temperature's reached

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,700
a certain amount.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,090
Here's an example of using a loop

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,210
to repeat this checking continuously.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,300
The while loop is a particular form of a loop,

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,610
Python has two, and in this loop we can repeat something

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,060
for as long as a condition is true.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,550
Here's how you might go about it.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,270
Let's have a variable is programmer

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,370
and that's going to be true.

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,410
And we're gonna say while is programmer is true,

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,880
print 'hello world'.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,440
Now we know from the if statement

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,990
that this is an optional thing,

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,050
so we can just have while is programmer,

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,110
we're gonna print 'hello world'.

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,230
Now, I cannot recommend that you run this,

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,240
although I'm gonna run it anyway

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,440
and I may regret it, the computer may crash.

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,010
Okay, there you go.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,000
So a lot of 'hello worlds' were printed out.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,730
I don't think you can see my navigation bar

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,050
there too easily, there you go.

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,540
There's a lot of hello worlds.

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,890
And that's because is programmer is always true.

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,130
So we're just running and running and running continuously.

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,960
This is called an infinite loop

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,790
because we've got a loop that is repeating continuously

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,110
without ever stopping.

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,880
We've not told it when to stop, so it just doesn't.

40
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,010
We could run this loop once, like so.

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,030
And then we could run it

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,280
and we would only print 'hello world' once.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,640
Obviously this is a pretty silly loop.

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,590
You could just not have the loop at all

45
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,750
and just print 'hello world' once.

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,270
But normally this stopping condition

47
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,270
would be a result of some other part

48
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,000
of the system doing something.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,370
For example, we could ask the user

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,670
whether they have become a programmer already.

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,810
So let's modify this loop slightly.

52
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,640
Let's start by saying is programmer is false.

53
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,210
We'll change the four loop to while not is programmer.

54
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,380
We're gonna say learn programming

55
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,840
and then we're gonna ask the user whether

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,460
they've become a programmer already.

57
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,860
User is programmer is going to be input.

58
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,510
"Are you a programmer yet?"

59
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,940
Now, they're gonna say yes or no.

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,790
So we'll say is programmer equal,

61
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,040
user is programmer equal equal, yes.

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,610
Now we know that all variables

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,570
are assigned with this equal sign

64
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,100
and what happens is that we execute the right part first,

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
then we assign the variable to that.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,680
So in here, we're gonna run this input,

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,180
we're gonna ask the user something,

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,560
as we've seen in the past.

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,370
The user's gonna be able to type something.

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,990
Whatever they type is going to be in this variable.

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,350
For example, let's say they've typed "no."

72
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,300
Again, we've got another variable here

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,940
with an equal sign, we're gonna evaluate this right side

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,080
of the expression first,

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,300
and then we're gonna put it inside this variable.

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,000
"No," which is what the user typed, equal, equal, yes.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,720
This is going to be false,

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,890
so is programmer is going to be false.

79
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,480
However, if they typed yes to begin with,

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,660
then yes is going to be equal to yes,

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,610
and this is going to be true.

82
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,780
The is programmer variable will be true,

83
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,500
and the loop will stop.

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,333
Let's run this.

85
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,990
We've got learn programming, badly misspelt,

86
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,955
I just realised that.

87
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,600
Sorry about that.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,670
Are you a programmer yet and we're gonna say "no,"

89
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,880
so it's gonna ask us again, "no, no, no, no."

90
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,690
You don't become a programmer so quickly,

91
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,760
but after some time, let's say a few weeks,

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,740
or a couple of months, we can now say "yes,"

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,707
and then it stops.

94
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:13,210
That's a pretty crappy loop,

95
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,140
it doesn't even congratulate us.

96
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,800
Don't worry, there will be plenty of congratulations

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,250
when you become a programmer.

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,530
Okay, so this is an example

99
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,550
of something you could do with that while loop.

100
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,393
Maybe not the most useful example,

101
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:29,201
but nonetheless, it can be done.

102
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,810
A while loop can also be used

103
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,330
to repeat something a specific number of times.

104
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,540
How may we do that?

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,070
Well, let's define a variable which I'm gonna call i

106
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,810
for index and it's gonna be equal to zero.

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,860
While i is less that ten,

108
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,430
we're going to print something like, repeated i times.

109
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,750
And then, of course, i is zero at the start.

110
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,810
We're going to check whether i is less than ten,

111
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,280
which is true, so we're gonna run this.

112
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,650
Then we're gonna go back, i is gonna still be zero,

113
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,130
it's less than ten, so we're gonna repeat it again,

114
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,710
and then again, and again, and again, and again.

115
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,100
i is always zero, so this is gonna be an infinite loop.

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,320
What do we do in order to make this not an infinite loop?

117
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,630
You go it, all we have to do is say i is equal

118
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,590
to i plus one.

119
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,120
Again, the right side evaluates first,

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,940
zero plus one is one, then it gets put back into i.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,180
So now i will be equal to one.

122
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,780
Next time the loop runs, i is one.

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,020
One plus one is two, i will be two.

124
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,321
Then two plus one, three plus one,

125
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,700
four plus one and so forth.

126
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,060
Eventually i becomes ten, and ten is not less than ten,

127
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,490
this becomes false, and we stop running.

128
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,323
Let's run that.

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,930
First it asks us whether we're a programmer.

130
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,870
Well, we've been able to create this loop down here,

131
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,480
so let's say "yes."

132
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,860
And then as you can see it repeats ten times,

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,560
from zero down to nine.

134
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,270
This is how you can use a while loop

135
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,940
to repeat something a number of times.

136
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,460
However, in the next few videos we're gonna learn

137
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,350
an even better way of doing that.

138
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,390
Okay, as I said earlier, I'm just gonna give you

139
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,510
another example with the temperature.

140
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,410
Temperature gonna be fifteen.

141
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,270
While the temperature is less than twenty.

142
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,390
We're gonna print heating,

143
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,840
and we're gonna say temperature is equal

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
to temperature plus one.

145
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,850
So we're gonna heat, presumably, five times.

146
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,170
Let's run that.

147
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,920
Again, we'll say yes to the programming,

148
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,910
and then we've got heating five times

149
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,122
because temperature became fifteen, then sixteen,

150
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:38,070
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and then twenty.

151
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,590
Of course, we can reduce this and shorten it

152
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,730
so that instead of temperature equals temperature plus one,

153
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,530
we could just say plus equal one.

154
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,200
And that means the same thing.

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,033
Okay?

156
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,690
This means temperature equal temperature plus one.

157
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,320
Similarly here, i plus equal one.

158
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,250
Of course, instead of continuously rising the temperature,

159
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,330
we would get this temperature from a sensor,

160
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,530
or a raspberry pie, or a thermometer,

161
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,830
or something like that.

162
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,810
So this while loop would only heat

163
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,380
while the temperature is less than certain amount.

164
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,505
Something important to note is,

165
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:16,505
is that as soon as the temperature reaches twenty,

166
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,170
this while loop ends, so even if the temperature

167
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,260
were to go below twenty later on,

168
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,680
this while loop wouldn't keep running.

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,780
It would have stopped.

170
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,600
So we would need to have some way of restarting this loop

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,210
when the temperature reaches less than twenty.

172
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,680
We'll look into that later on in the course.

173
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,090
We'll look at how we can do that sort of stuff.

174
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,190
I just wanted to show you the syntax of the four loop,

175
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,978
how you go about writing them,

176
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,660
because as we progress through the course,

177
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,670
again, we'll be working on some projects

178
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,250
and you sort of have to know they syntax of Python

179
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,430
before you can delve into some more advanced projects.

180
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,670
Think of these as getting the tools you need

181
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,120
to start doing your woodworking maybe,

182
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,700
or your gardening in your garden.

183
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,970
If you don't have any tools,

184
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,160
it's gonna be pretty difficult for you to do any projects.

185
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,570
But as soon as you've got a few chisels

186
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,403
and some sanders and sandpaper,

187
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:12,670
you can start doing a bunch of stuff.

188
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,740
Of course, this course is gonna bring you

189
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,830
much more than chiselling.

190
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,040
It's gonna give you a lot more tools

191
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,910
and you'll learn a lot about those as we progress.

192
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,530
As I said, this course is going to bring you

193
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,900
to an expert level.

194
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,850
So let's move on into the next video

195
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,300
and continue learning Python.
