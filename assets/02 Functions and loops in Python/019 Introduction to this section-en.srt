<v ->Welcome to the second section.</v>

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,100
In this section, we're going to look at some more advanced

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,280
Python and programming constructs,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,530
like functions, loops, if-statements and more.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,810
These things are essential to allowing your programmes

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,730
to grow without them becoming too messy

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,251
and too confusing.

8
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,950
In addition, it allows your programmes to repeat things

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,570
and make choices, things which are essential

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,160
in order to develop larger and more complicated programmes.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,100
I'm sure you're going to enjoy this section.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,650
I'll see you in the next video.
