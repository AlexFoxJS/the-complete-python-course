00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,420
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,300
In this video, we're going to look at set operations.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,860
These are more advanced operations

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,930
than we saw in the last video

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,420
and they can be really useful in some cases.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,110
Let's define two sets,

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,810
set one, which is going to be

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,370
one, two, three, four, five

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,100
and set two which is going to be

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,000
one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,410
Okay so these two sets,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,630
they both have some numbers in them,

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,920
you can notice some numbers are similar

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,950
between both sets, some numbers are different

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,890
between both sets so let's look at some operations.

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,360
Now, if you have done maths in the past

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,850
you probably know about the operations I'm

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,790
about to tell you.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,350
You probably know about union of sets,

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,920
you probably know about intersection of sets,

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,640
you may even know about the difference

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,070
between sets.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,900
So we're going to look at those three

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,080
in this video.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,510
Now, the intersection of sets is

26
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,020
the elements between two sets that are matching

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,250
so if you have set one with values

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,340
one, two, three, four and five

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,960
and set two with values

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,470
one, three, five, seven, nine and eleven,

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,820
the elements that match between the two

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,780
are one three and five.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,930
So the intersection of those two sets

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,220
is the set containing one, three and five.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,390
Let's get back to coding and show you exactly what I mean.

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
Set one,

37
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,060
and now we want to do something with set one

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,220
so it's going to be dot intersection

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,960
and then inside the brackets of this intersection

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,500
we're gonna put set two, now I know

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,750
it's not terribly clear exactly what these things are

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,500
and why we've got these brackets in there

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,700
but please bear with me for now,

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,960
we will get to it very soon.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,110
So we've got set one, then we're performing the intersection

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,580
on it with set two.

47
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,250
That's what this means inside the brackets,

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,510
we're gonna give it set two,

49
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,120
we're gonna intersect it with set one.

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,730
Let's run it

51
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,380
and as you can see we get the set one three and five.

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,635
The union of two sets

53
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:27,280
is for two sets that

54
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,130
are different and have matching numbers,

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,130
the union is the total set of numbers

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,910
in both sets, once you've removed any duplicates.

57
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,650
So for example, if you have one, two, three, four and five

58
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,270
in one set and one, three, five, seven, nine and eleven

59
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,941
in another set, the final set is one that contains

60
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,470
one, two, three, four, five and also contains

61
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,130
seven, nine and eleven.

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,530
Let's get back to coding and I'll show you

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,690
exactly what I mean.

64
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,444
Set one dot union with set two.

65
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:09,950
Let's run that.

66
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,090
And as you can see we've got

67
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,340
one, two, three, four and five and then we've got

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,750
seven, nine and eleven.

69
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,160
So the union unites both sets

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,210
and give us the resultant set.

71
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,310
Finally we've got the difference,

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,830
difference between two sets

73
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,850
is one set take away the other,

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,140
so any elements that aren't in one set,

75
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,820
minus any elements that are in the other set

76
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,220
will result in a difference.

77
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,850
So again, if we have one set

78
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,000
with one, two, three, four and five

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,110
and the other set with

80
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,060
one, three, five, seven, nine and eleven,

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,160
if you do set one difference set two,

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,584
set one minus set two, you end up

83
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:56,930
with one, sorry with two and four.

84
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,250
Because that is one, two, three, four, five

85
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,970
minus one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven.

86
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,830
Let's get back into programing

87
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,480
and show you exactly what I mean.

88
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,090
Here we've got set one, we're going to calculate

89
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,300
the difference of it with set two.

90
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,780
And as you can see, we get two and four.

91
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,446
These are three pretty useful set operations

92
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:30,540
for example, if you were creating a lottery programme,

93
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,810
you could have a set for the numbers you've chosen

94
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,800
and another set for the numbers that have appeared

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,470
in the lottery and then it would be really

96
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,980
easy to know how many you got right,

97
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,530
just by doing the intersection.

98
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,198
Similarly, if you were

99
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,400
checking the

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,250
number of visitors to a webpage

101
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,920
and you wanted to, you know,

102
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
and you have another set of the visitors

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
to have previously visited your site,

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,780
you can easily calculate which ones are repeat visitors,

105
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,050
again by using the intersection.

106
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,870
You could also use the difference to get new visitors.

107
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,970
So as you can see, these things

108
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,410
can be quite useful in some scenarios

109
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,960
and also, it's a good way to introduce

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,110
to some more advanced concepts here in Python.

111
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,990
Knowing about sets doesn't mean that you'll forever remember

112
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,210
everything we've talked about in this video

113
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,710
but as long as you know that these things exist,

114
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,670
in the future when you encounter a situation

115
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,570
where you may need to use one of these things,

116
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,890
it'll probably come back to mind

117
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,670
and you'll maybe think, I remember something to do

118
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,700
with sets that was useful to get unique numbers

119
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,800
or things like that

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,500
and maybe then you'll go and Google it

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,670
and that will be this video fulfilling this purpose.

122
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,540
Again you don't have to remember everything,

123
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,310
just keep it in your head

124
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,820
and programming will be all about

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,750
being able to then recombine all that knowledge

126
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,850
into something useful.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,310
Also, I'll just quickly mention

128
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,800
that you can do set one, ampersand set two

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,250
and that is the same thing,

130
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,330
so these two do the same thing.

131
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,680
You can do set one,

132
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,490
pipe set two and again,

133
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,660
these two are the same thing,

134
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,230
union and pipe do the same thing

135
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,900
and finally you can do set one minus set two

136
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,340
and these two are also the same thing.

137
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,410
So these are just shortcuts for that,

138
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,710
probably not going to be very useful

139
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,770
for you just yet, but nonetheless,

140
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,960
this can be done and again

141
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,260
when you go back into Googling later on

142
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,320
in your career, you'll remember this as well.

143
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,700
So that's it for this video.

144
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,360
Sets are gonna come in handy

145
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,630
more and more as we move on throughout the course

146
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,410
and so don't worry,

147
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,490
it's not wasted time.

148
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,740
Let's move onto the next video

149
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,908
where we're gonna look at an extension

150
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,650
of sets that can be really useful.

151
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,990
I'll see you soon.
