00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi and welcome back! In this video we're going to talk about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
how to get the length of a list.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the last video we briefly saw how to get the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
total sum of different elements in a list.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For example, if we have a list called

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
"grades", and this has the elements

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[95, 50, 75, and 100].

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We saw that we could

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
do sum(), and then inside the

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
brackets of sum, we could put the grades list

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we say something like

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
total is that, and then we can print the total out

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and this would

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
calculate the total sum of each element here.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So it would give us 95 + 50

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
+ 75 + 100. I was about to add them all up in my head

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but then I realised I can't do that!

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So if we run this, we can see we get

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
320 there on the side.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, as you can see

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
this list has 4 elements, right?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It has 95, 50, 75, and 100.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There are 4 distinct elements

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in this list. So if we wanted

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to know how many elements there are,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we can do that by

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
calculating the length of the list.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, we could do something like, say

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
length is equal to len

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
of grades. So, just like

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
sum gives us the total addition of all elements,

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
len gives us the total count

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
of elements—how many elements there are.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So then we can print length, and you'll see that we

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
get 320 and then 4 here on the side.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These two things here,

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we're going to look at them in much more details over the rest of the

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
course, but they are very useful—and indeed you

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
may need this one for the next exercise.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There are more things that we can do other than

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
sum() and len(), and again, we will learn

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
about the other things you can do with lists and other collections

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
later on in the course.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
And by the way, this len() and this sum()

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
work on lists, but they also work on tuples

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
so if we make our grades list

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
we make it a tuple, this'll still

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
work fine.

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
And the len() also works in dictionaries

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
and sets. So you can also get how many

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
elements there are in a dictionary or a set.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Generally, I'd advise you play around

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
with these things and give it a go—see where they work, where they don't

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
work—because that's a really good way of sort of

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
getting accustomed and getting to grips with everything that

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
there is to do in programming; by playing around with it

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
and giving it a go. Nonetheless, we've got a coding exercise

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
coming up next, so please

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
tackle that one—you're going to need to use the len()

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
keyword in it, so give it a go and then come back

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
and we will continue. I'll see you soon!
