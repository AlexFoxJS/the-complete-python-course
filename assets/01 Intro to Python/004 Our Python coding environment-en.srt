Hi there, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,950 line:15% 
In this video we're going to talk about repl.it.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,500
When you start a new coding course the instructor normally

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,980
asks you to instal a bunch of things.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,800
For example I can ask you to instal Python,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,780
I can ask you to instal somewhere to write your Python code

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,780
A popular example is popular example is PyCharm.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,700
But normally there are problems that come from that

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,570
and now that we're learning the very basics of Python

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,250
and we're going to start at the very beginning

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,100
we don't need the power

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,129
that something so specific gives us.

13
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:37,810
So what we're going to do in this course

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,750
is we're going to start with a cloud coding environment

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,830
That's going to allow us to really quickly learn Python

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,930
And then as we transition over to building larger

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,850
and more complex apps, we will be downloading

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,750
and installing all those tools.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,800
But to begin with we don't need that

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,610
because we're going to be learning about how Python works

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,040
and we can do that really easily and really well

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,770
in this cloud coding environment.

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,490
Through this video we're going to talk about why

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,550
I recommend using this and why I think you should use this.

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,610
Let's go over to repl.it on your browser,

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,970
and you'll be greeted with this web page.

27
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,670
And in it, you can search for a language

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,420
and we're going to select Python3.

29
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:25,010
Python3 here is Python 3.6 which is the latest

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,060
version of Python at the time of recording

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,780
although Python 3.7 is coming out soon.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,820
So you can use all of the modern Python constructs

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,530
and we're going to learn about all of them in this course.

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,280
One of the key benefits of using repl.it

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,673
and the main reason why I recommend that you use it,

36
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:49,673
is because your code is always saved into a unique URL.

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,610
So at any point in time, you can share your code

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,210
with this link here and you can send it to me

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,600
if you have any questions or you want any feedback.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Or even if you have any problems

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
and you don't know what is causing them.

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,600
What you see here is your Python code on the left.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,740
And the second button, the run button,

44
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,040
will execute your code and show you the output

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,380
here on the right.

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,970
That means that you can really easily

47
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,150
run your code and try it out as you go along

48
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,060
without having to download things and run them

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,690
in the console and so forth.

50
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,170
Okay?

51
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,660
So as we write our Python code, we're going to be running it

52
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,540
really frequently as that's really the best way to learn

53
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,260
is by trying things out, writing code,

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,660
playing around with it, changing it,

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,240
and seeing how the changes affect the outcome.

56
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,900
Throughout the entire course I'll be frequently asking you

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,470
to pause the video and try things out yourselves.

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,060
I would encourage you to pause the video when I ask you to,

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,040
and try to implement whatever code we're working with

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,873
at the time.

61
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,760
By trying things out and by programming yourself,

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,560
you're really going to expedite your learning massively.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,350
In addition, I would always encourage you

64
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,320
to write code alongside the video.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,680
Don't just watch the video

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,940
and say you're going to write the code later on

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,670
because we both know what's going to happen,

68
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,070
you'll watch it and then you won't write the code

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,000
and then you'll forget everything

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,060
and that's a waste of time for everybody.

71
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,680
So what to do is code alongside me

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,530
and when I ask you to pause the video

73
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,690
and do some exercise, do just that.

74
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,070
In addition, throughout the course I'll also have

75
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,530
dedicated exercises on Udemy

76
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,660
that you can complete and test your knowledge

77
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,590
that way as well.

78
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,970
So that's it for this video.

79
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,240
Hopefully you're all setup with repl.it.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,160
In the next video we're going to start with Python.

81
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,210
We're going to look at variables and numbers.

82
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,510 line:15% 
So that's it and I'll see you on the next one.
