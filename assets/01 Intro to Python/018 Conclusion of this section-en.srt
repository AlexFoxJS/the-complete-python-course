<v ->Congratulations on finishing this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,050
We've looked at Python fundamentals

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,370
and now you have a bunch of knowledge that you can apply.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,490
Of course, we still have to look

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,780
at building some projects using Python.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,100
Throughout the next few sections,

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,670
we're going to be doing just that.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,120
But first, there's a little bit more we have to know

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,630
in terms of repeating things

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,000
and allowing our programmes to make choices.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,950
We'll look at that in the next section.
