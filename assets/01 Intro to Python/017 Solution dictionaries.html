<p>This is my solution to the coding exercise. Again, it may be slightly different from yours!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">lottery_numbers = {13, 21, 22, 5, 8}

"""
A player looks like this:

{
    'name': 'PLAYER_NAME',
    'numbers': {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
}

Define a list with two players (you can come up with their names and numbers).
"""
players = [
    {
        'name': 'Rolf',
        'numbers': {1, 3, 8, 22, 21}
    },
    {
        'name': 'Jose',
        'numbers': {4, 9, 10, 12, 15}
    }
]

# For each of the two players, print out a string like this: "Player PLAYER_NAME got 3 numbers right.".
# Of course, replace PLAYER_NAME by their name, and the 3 by the amount of numbers they matched with lottery_numbers.
# You'll have to access each player's name and numbers, and calculate the intersection of their numbers with lottery_numbers.
# Then construct a string and print it out.

# Remember: the string must contain the player's name and the amount of numbers they got right!
name = players[0]['name']
numbers = players[0]['numbers'].intersection(lottery_numbers)
print('Player {name} got {amount} numbers right.'.format(name=name, amount=len(numbers)))

name = players[1]['name']
numbers = players[1]['numbers'].intersection(lottery_numbers)
print('Player {name} got {amount} numbers right.'.format(name=name, amount=len(numbers)))</pre>

<p>Let me know how you got on!</p>
