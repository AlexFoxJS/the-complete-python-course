I've also founded the company Teclado

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,530
to bring software development learning to everyone.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,010
This course will take you from beginner to expert

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,700

and straightforward, while never leaving you confused.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,240
Why learn Python at all?

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,560
Over the last few years,

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,800
Python has become more and more popular,

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,330
booming in the job market.

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,100
Python is extremely popular for many things,

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,840
like data science, web development, home automation,

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,700
and much more.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,780
Python is one of the most loved programming languages

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,820
and also the most wanted language according

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,150
to recent industry surveys.

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,360
If people are not using Python already,

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
they want to start using Python.

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,050
This course will make it easy for you to learn Python

26
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,220
and get ahead of the masses.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,670
Who is this course for?

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,850
For beginners who've never programmed before,

29
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,550
but want to start learning Python.

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,220
Or for programmers coming in from other languages,

31
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,180
who want to kick start their Python programming.

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,130
Finally, it's also really good for Python programmers

33
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,000
who want to brush-up on their skills

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,100
and really get proficient at using Python.

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,590
I'll give you a quick overview of the course.

36
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,120
We'll dive right into Python.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,810
The tools presented in this course

38
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,170
means you don't have to worry

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,370
about installing anything in your computer

40
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,690
until you are comfortable with Python.

41
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,520
That means we can be productive right from the start.

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,670
You'll have lifetime access to over 100 lectures

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,640
covering all aspects of Python,

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
from the foundations to advanced concepts

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,810
in a clear and concise manner.

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,000
Each lecture includes a screen cast video

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,240
and also complete written notes and code

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,720
for you to read and refer back to as you progress

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,670
through the course.

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,970
Videos are interactive

51
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,820
with pauses for you to think and write code,

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,610
and also there's quizzes and tests all along the way

53
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,410
for you to check your understanding.

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,600
We also have a number of milestone projects

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,140
for you to complete as you go through the course.

56
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,390
These provide a challenge and an opportunity

57
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,510 line:15% 
for you to apply what you've learned.

58
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,710 line:15% 
We always go over the code after

59
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,700 line:15% 
to show you how we would tackle them.

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,210
This course teaches not just Python,

61
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,290 line:15% 
but also common pitfalls and best practises,

62
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,430 line:15% 
including how to make your code Pythonic,

63
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,460 line:15% 
that's looking like professional code,

64
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,250 line:15% 
object-oriented programming, database interactions,

65
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,100 line:15% 
and much more.

66
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,340
By the way, something that differentiates us

67
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,610
from other courses is the amount of help and support

68
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,730
that we provide each student.

69
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,980
In the last year alone,

70
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,570
we've answered over 3,000 student questions.

71
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,330
We don't leave a single question unanswered.

72
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,270
This is the best investment you can make

73
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,900
in your Python journey.

74
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,570
But, don't let me be the one to tell you that.
