1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,980
<v Jose>Hi, it's great to have you</v>

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,030
in this curriculum overview.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,400
What you are about to witness

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,670
is an overview of the most complete Python course.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,850
We're going to go all the way from Python basics,

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,980
covering object-oriented programming,

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,450
errors and error handling, databases,

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,600
a bunch of advanced Python development,

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,640
including a unique topic in Python courses,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
asynchronous Python development,

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,400
web scraping,

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,180
algorithms and data structures, and much more.

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,550
We're going to do this by building a bunch of projects,

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,300
and we're going to start with our first one,

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,490
which is a movie classification system.

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,950
For this project we're going to be interacting with users,

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,690
and getting them to tell us the movies they've got,

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,180
and also we'll allow them to search through them

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,930
and retrieve existing movies.

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,190
Think of it as managing your personal collection.

21
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,170
For this, we'll learn about Python fundamentals,

22
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,440
interacting with users,

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,120
if statements and functions and loops.

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,870
At the end, we'll have our first project.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,520
For milestone project number two,

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
we'll build a book collection.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,260
Here we have to learn a bunch more Python

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,300
in order to allow our programmes to grow organically,

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,230
as they become more complex.

30
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,360
In addition, this project will be saving

31
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,340
things to our computer,

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,020
so that we can keep the status of the programme

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,030
from one time we run it to the next.

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,560
We'll be learning about more advanced topics,

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
like object-oriented programming,

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,690
errors and error handling,

37
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,010
as well as delving into files.

38
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,350
In addition, we'll cover a more complex topic,

39
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,470
called relative imports.

40
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,600
This can be a bit tricky to get right,

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
but this course is going to guide you through it perfectly.

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,080
At the end we'll have our milestone project two completed,

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,580
which will allow us to manage our book collection.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,810
Then, we'll quickly extend this project

45
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,700
by introducing databases,

46
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,460
context managers, and type hinting.

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,820
These are a bit more advanced topics

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,590
that will greatly increase the power of our programme.

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,730
Then we'll move on to milestone project three,

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,130
where we'll start looking at web scraping,

51
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,660
and we'll start with quotes.

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,270
Our quote scraping project

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,780
will allow us to get information from a website

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,020
in the form of quotes that famous people have said,

55
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,660
and save them to our computer,

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,550
and access them later on.

57
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,180
This is a great example

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,900
of a lot of advanced functionality.

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,590
We're going to look at things like generators

60
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,840
and regular expressions,

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,210
dates and times,

62
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,700
as well of course, web scraping.

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,340
Web scraping is really popular these days

64
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,440
because, you know, you don't want to be

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,550
all the time looking at various different websites,

66
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,400
trying to get information from them,

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,320
when you can write a programme to do that for you.

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,430
So by the time we're done,

69
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,150
we'll have our third milestone project,

70
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,370
which is going to be a quotes scraper.

71
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,200
Then we'll move on to milestone project number four,

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,910
which will also be a scraper,

73
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,830
but a much more complicated one,

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,350
looking at scraping and online store,

75
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,310
so we can get information from it.

76
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,130
For example, the items that are available in stock,

77
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,970
and how much they cost.

78
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,670
You can use this to set alarms for yourself

79
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,520
when an item goes on sale, for example,

80
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,110
and for this we'll use everything we've learned so far,

81
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,378
and more professional-grade web scraping.

82
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:22,800
This will be our fourth milestone project.

83
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,085
Of course, this is a whole lot of Python,

84
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,540
and that's not all.

85
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,480
Throughout the course we'll also look at other things,

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,840
like decorators,

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,580
algorithms and data structures,

88
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,926
and many other popular Python libraries

89
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,720
that you can learn and use in your own projects.

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,250
Throughout the entire course

91
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,750
you'll have access to dozens of quizzes

92
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,650
and interactive programming tests,

93
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,730
so you can check your knowledge as you go along.

94
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,279
These are also extremely handy

95
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,630
for learning and retaining what you've learned.

96
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,320
In addition, you'll get access to the complete notes

97
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,160
and all of the code we'll write throughout

98
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,650
the entire course,

99
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,600
just so you can play around with it,

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,530
download it, and have a read.

101
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,330
My students love the support

102
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,760
and personal guidance I provide.

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
Whenever you need it,

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,110
I'm always there to help you out

105
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,330
and answer your questions.

106
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,220
Finally, by taking the course,

107
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,310
you know you're in the best hands.

108
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,950
This course is taught by myself,

109
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,790
a professional software engineer,

110
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,390
so you know you're getting the best practises,

111
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,670
and the best knowledge available.

112
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,640
That's it for the curriculum overview,

113
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,480
so I'll see you on the inside.
