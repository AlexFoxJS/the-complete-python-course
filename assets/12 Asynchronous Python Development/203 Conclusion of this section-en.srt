00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,320
<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of a section.</v>

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,470
Over time, we're gonna try

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,300
to add some more content to this section

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,080
so that things become even clearer.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,010
However,

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,560
scouring the Internet for conference talks

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,090
and going to conferences

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,390
is a great way to learn more about these obscure topics,

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,240
like asynchronous Python development.

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,350
Hopefully, though, we've made it a bit clearer,

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,090
and now you understand from first principles

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,110
how asynchronous development works in Python.

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,670
From generators

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,040
to coroutines

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,340
to yield from

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,480
and now to the new syntax in Python,

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,010
async and await.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,930
Hopefully you enjoyed this section

19
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,580
and I'll see you on the next one.
