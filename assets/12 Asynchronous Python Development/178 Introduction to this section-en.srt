00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,880
<v ->Welcome to this section.</v>

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,420
In this section we're going to look

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,770
at one of the most complicated topics in Python.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,300
So complicated in fact that I have not seen another course

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,940
that covers this topic.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,760
The topic is asynchronous development with Python

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,950
and that means doing multiple things at once essentially.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,230
I'll let you know that you cannot run two things at once

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,110
in Python, but throughout this section we're going to look

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,370
at how you can pretend like you do

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,320
and how that can speed up your programmes.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,140
Asynchronous development, as I said, is a complicated topic,

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,380
so throughout this section,

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,450
I'm also going to be referring you to a number

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,780
of other videos and other sources

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,540
from some of Python's developers themselves

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,440
who have worked on making Python a language

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,390
that supports asynchronous development.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,610
Again, bare with me.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,130
If you have any questions throughout the entire section,

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,450
ask away in the course Q and A,

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,880
and if anything confuses you,

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,800
ask away in the course Q and A,

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,620
and we will be glad to help you out.

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,040
I'll see you on the next video.
