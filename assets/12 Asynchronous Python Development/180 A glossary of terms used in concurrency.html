A lot of developers are scared of what we're going to learn in this section.</p><p>You shouldn't be scared!</p><p>We'll start at the fundamentals, and build out our knowledge of asynchronous development from the ground up.</p><p>Throughout the section we'll learn more about what these terms mean, but it can be helpful to have a short glossary of terms just in case you want to come back and remind yourself.</p><ul><li><strong>Synchronous</strong>: actions that happen one after another. Programming as we've seen it until now is synchronous, because each line executes after the previous one.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous</strong>: actions that don't necessary happen after one another, or that can happen in arbitrary order ("without synchrony").</li><li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: The ability of our programs to run things in different order every time the program runs, without affecting the final outcome.</li><li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: Running two or more things at the same time.</li><li><strong>Thread</strong>: A line of code execution that can run in one of your computer's cores.</li><li><strong>Process</strong>: One of more threads and the resources they need (e.g. network connection, mouse pointer, hard drive access, or even the core(s) in which the thread(s) run).</li><li><strong>GIL</strong>: A key, critical, important resource in any Python program. Only one is created per Python process, so it's unique in each.</li></ul><p>Take it slowly through this section, and ask questions in the Course Q&amp;A as required. We're here to help!</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Jose</p></p>
