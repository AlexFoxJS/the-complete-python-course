<v ->Welcome to section three.</v>

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,610
This section, we'll build our first milestone project

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,989
and unfortunately, we also have

4
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:11,570
to instal some software in our computers.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,620
By now you're experienced enough with Python

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,100
that I think we can tackle this.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
We've been studying Python

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,970
so that we can run Python programmes

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,340
and also PyCharm so we can write Python code

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,217
in our computers and then we'll

11
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:28,690
be tackling building our first milestone project

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,680
which is a movie classification system.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,240
I'll see you in the next video.
