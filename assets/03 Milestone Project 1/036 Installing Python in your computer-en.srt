<v Male Narrator>Hi there and welcome to this section.</v>

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,520
We're going to be building our first milestone project

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,860
in this section.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,220
In order to do that, we are going to be using

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,340
our computer and an editor in our computer,

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,100
instead of REPL 8, our cloud editor.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,520
You can totally build this project in the cloud editor,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,950
if you want.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,620
But I thought it could be a good time

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,660
to introduce how to set up Python on your editor.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,290
Again, if you want to stay using REPL 8

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,590
for this project, you can do so.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,650
For the next milestone project we build,

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,990
you will definitely need to instal Python.

15
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:45,750
Okay, so let's go over to www.python.org

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,640
and then you'll be greeted with a site

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,610
that will look, more or less, like this one.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,830
At the time of recording, is a pretty exciting time,

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,430
because Python 3.7 is about to come out very soon.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,230
But at the time of recording, we're still in Python 3.6.

21
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:06,830
The differences between 3.7 and 3.6 are gonna be something,

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,140
but nothing that will affect us up to this point,

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,270
and indeed, not for the next few sections, either.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,410
So, don't worry about 3.6 or 3.7.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,600
If you see 3.7 here, let me know in the course Q and A,

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,830
'cause I want to know as soon as it's out,

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,260
so that we can add a bunch more stuff for the course,

28
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,210
just for 5 and 3.7.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,480
But, for this project, for what we've seen already

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,490
and for what we'll see in the next few sections,

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,050
nothing's really gonna change.

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,850
So, go ahead and download 3.6 or 3.7

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,900
and you can instal it as you would any normal programme.

34
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,510
Now, if you are using windows, then as you open

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,580
the installer on the first window,

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,580
you'll see this checkbox, add Python to Path.

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,400
Make sure you check that box, that's really important.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,140
Other than that, other than that box,

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,050
everything can stay as the default

40
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,670
as you instal Python and you don't have anything

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,550
to worry about.

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,250
So, once that's installed, we can move on over

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,850
to the next video to instal Python.

44
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll see you there.
