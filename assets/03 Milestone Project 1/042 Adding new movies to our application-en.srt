00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,500 line:15% 
<v Instructor>Hi, and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,230 line:15% 
In this video we're going to continue

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,050 line:15% 
with our Milestone Project on adding movies.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,050
Now, in the last video we added these tasks.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,610
And we created a bunch of them,

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,700
like deciding where we're going to store movies,

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,520
what is the format of a movie,

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,440
to show the user the main interface and get their input,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,550
and also to allow users to add movies,

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,620
show movies, find movies, and stop running the programme.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,140
Now I think we've done a couple of these.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,931
So I'm gonna just add an X here,

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,600
to say that we've done them.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,433
And I think what we've done,

15
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:36,210
is we've shown the user the main interface,

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,030
and that's this line of text here.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,650
And we've gotten their input,

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,270
and also we've allowed the user to stop running the programme

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,320
when they type 'q'.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,170
Now, before we can allow users to add movies,

21
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,475
I think we need to choose what it is that they're gonna add,

22
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,930
and where they're gonna be stored.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,460
So we're gonna do these two tasks up here.

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,840
Where to store movies, and what is a movie.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,780
In a larger programme as I said earlier on,

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,980
normally these movies would be stored in a database

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,490
or maybe a file, or something like that.

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,480
But because we've not looked at databases and files yet,

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,840
we're going to store these movies in a structure

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,620
that we do know.

31
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,040
Now, what might that be?

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,210
I'm sure you guessed a potential correct data structure,

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,920
I would use a list, but you could use a set if you wanted.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,280
I wouldn't recommend using a tuple.

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,550
So a list I think is a good choice.

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,270
So I've created the variable called Movies,

37
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,100
and made it equal to an empty list.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,330
This is going to store all of our movies

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,980
when we are running this programme.

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,540
So we've decided where to store the movies,

41
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,210
now we have to decide, what is a movie?

42
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,810
What's the format of a movie?

43
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,800
For me, I think that a movie is going to be a dictionary

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
that has a name, that's going to be a string,

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,760
it's going to have a director,

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,590
that's also going to be a string,

47
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,760
and it's also going to have a year,

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,100
that's going to be an int.

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,800
These are going to be my movies.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,580
If you want to store something different,

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,530
by all means, feel free to do so.

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,019
I mean, this is your programme,

53
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,810
it'll be fairly straightforward

54
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,280
to add different things in there.

55
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,700
Now that we've decided what the format of a movie

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,930
is going to be, and where we're gonna store them,

57
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,430
we know that when we add a new movie,

58
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,150
what we're gonna to is create a dictionary

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,090
that looks like this, and put it into our list.

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,290
So let's go and do that.

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,720
Underneath the Menu function,

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,950
let's define the Add Movie function.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,930
Again, if up til now you've not felt confident to develop

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,120
this function on your own,

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,470
and you feel like you're more confident now,

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,220
pause the video and give it a go.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,500
And I'm gonna keep saying this,

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,600
because it's really the best way to learn.

69
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,780
Okay, now that hopefully you've tackled it,

70
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,400
or you've done it earlier on,

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,460
we're ready to ask the user for the details

72
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,040
that we're gonna store in our movie.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,010
So what we're gonna do,

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,440
is ask the user for a name,

75
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
we're gonna ask the user for a director,

76
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,780
and we're gonna ask the user for a year.

77
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:44,450
Now we did say the year is going to be an integer,

78
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,640
so I'm gonna turn this into an int right there

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,630
as we go along.

80
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,390
Just to make sure that the year is an integer,

81
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,620
and I'm not gonna use it as a string by accident

82
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,720
or anything like that.

83
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,950
And then all we wanna do is make sure that we

84
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,280
create a new dictionary,

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,800
and we put it into our movie's list.

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
So what to do, movies.append,

87
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:09,180
and create a new dictionary here which is going to have

88
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,180
the name, director, and the year keys.

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,030
Notice how I've created this dictionary here,

90
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,880
inside the append function, and that's totally fine to do,

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,840
but if you prefer you can create a separate variable

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,160
up here, say like, movie is this,

93
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400
and append the movie here.

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,220
Totally up to you, what you prefer doing.

95
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,480
This may be slightly more readable for you,

96
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,590
if you choose you can do that.

97
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,390
But for me, this is fairly readable.

98
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,550
This tells me that what I'm appending to my list

99
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,020
is a dictionary that has these pieces of data.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
Okay?

101
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,650
And I know that this is a movie

102
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,530
because the list is called Movies.

103
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,920
So I don't have to define a separate variable called Movie

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,420
just to tell me that what I'm creating is a movie.

105
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,730
Now we've got our Add Movie function,

106
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,620
whenever we go and run this function we're going to ask the

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,560
user for three details,

108
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,060
and we're going to append a dictionary with those details

109
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,110
into our movies list.

110
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,340
So what I'm going to do,

111
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,870
is I'm going to evaluate the flow of the programme again

112
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,160
just for you, and then we're going to run this programme

113
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,210
and check that everything's working well.

114
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,510
As soon as we go down to line 58,

115
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,350
we've got our Menu function call.

116
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,180
So we're going to jump over to the Menu function,

117
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,300
where we're going to ask the user to enter something.

118
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,930
If they type 'a' we're going to jump right into

119
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,440
the Add Movie function, which is defined down here.

120
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,040
And this is fine because this function is already defined

121
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,390
by the time that we run our Menu function.

122
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,950
So we're gonna ask the user for the movie name,

123
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,240
director, and year,

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,210
we're gonna construct a new dictionary with the three keys,

125
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,960
and the values are going to be these variables up here,

126
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,260
and then we're going to append that dictionary

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,470
into our Movies list that is defined at the top in here.

128
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,253
Okay?

129
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,040
So, then we're going to finish running that,

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,810
we're going to skip the elif, elif, and else statements,

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,310
and we're going to ask the user for input again.

132
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,720
They can type 'a' again,

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,700
in which case we will go back to repeating the loop.

134
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,140
This will be true because a is not q,

135
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,860
and we will ask the user to add another movie.

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,570
And so on and so on, until the user types 'q',

137
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,940
in which case when we repeat the y loop,

138
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,280
q will be equal to q, so this will be false,

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
and we will stop running the programme.

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,530
When that happens, we will jump to the end of the y loop,

141
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,000
where the function ends,

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,690
so then we will jump back down to line 58,

143
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,380
and run line 59 which is empty, and then exit our programme.

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,760
So because inside this Menu function call,

145
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,510
the entire program's running,

146
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,040
we will potentially be adding a bunch of movies

147
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,910
inside this Menu function.

148
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,750
That's inside the y loop.

149
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,877
So what we can do after running the Menu function,

150
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,540
is print our movies list.

151
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,440
Then, when we run the Menu function,

152
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,090
we'll add a bunch of movies,

153
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,730
we will exit the Menu function at the end

154
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,460
when we type 'q', but our programme won't exit immediately,

155
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,590
it will first run this line Print Movies,

156
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,190
and then it will finish running.

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,860
This is why it's important for you to know

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,310
exactly where your programme is going step by step,

159
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,160
because this is now going to allow us to

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,460
make sure that our function is doing what we want it to do.

161
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,630
So let's run our app.

162
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,450
Once again you can right click app.py and run it,

163
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,890
or if you've done that before,

164
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,190
Pie Charm will tell you that this app thing here on the top

165
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,700
right is available for running,

166
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,900
and you can just run it in there.

167
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,733
Okay?

168
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,920
But normally I'd recommend that you right click the file,

169
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
and run it.

170
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
As then you'll make sure that you are

171
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
running the right thing.

172
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,516
So again, we see here our interface,

173
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:02,120
our user interface we can enter 'a', 'l', 'f', and 'q',

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,485
we're gonna type 'a' since that's the only thing

175
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,240
that's working, and we're gonna enter movie name,

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm going to enter the Matrix, the director.

177
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,100
I'm gonna enter Wochowski's The Two Sisters,

178
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,300
and the release year is gonna be 1994.

179
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,750
Then I'm gonna type 'q'.

180
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,470
And notice how I was right

181
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,490
and the movies get printed out after.

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,370
What we've got here is a list

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,130
with a single dictionary in it,

184
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,330
including the name, director,

185
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,160
and year that we've entered earlier.

186
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,500
Notice how the year is an integer, which is all good,

187
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,380
and the others are strings.

188
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,670
Now this is pretty awesome,

189
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,560
we've got really now a working application,

190
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,700
not terribly useful yet,

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,360
that allows us to add new movies into our list,

192
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,420
and then show them out to the user.

193
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,440
When we start adding the other functionality,

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,950
in the next couple of videos,

195
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,340
we're gonna find much more use for it.

196
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,850
But of course, because when we run this programme again,

197
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,250
and we type 'q' we get an empty list,

198
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,210
this programme isn't the most useful that it could be.

199
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,940
Every time we run the programme the list gets erased,

200
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,230
because Python only remembers it within the current runtime

201
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,720
of the app.

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,470
So this is a clear limitation of our programme,

203
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,870
and it is one we will surpass when we look at files

204
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,670
and databases, later on in this course.

205
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,870
So, this programme could be more useful,

206
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,360
but that doesn't mean it's not a great programme

207
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,280
to get started.

208
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,170
And again, I would encourage you if you've not done so

209
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,170
already, to try to finish writing the last two functions.

210
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,980 line:15% 
And if so, let's go on to the next video.

211
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,030 line:15% 
I will see you there.
