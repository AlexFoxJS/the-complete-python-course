00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,440
<v ->Congratulations on finishing this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,830
We've looked at Flask and doing web development with Python.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,780
We've learned that Python is an extremely popular language

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,613
for doing web.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,110
Flask allows us to serve our users with content

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,250
and get data back from them.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,830
That really is the main purpose

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,300
of web development as a whole.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,490
Now, you'll be able to much more easily

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,630
share your applications with the world

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,170
by creating websites and allowing your users

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,270
to interact with them.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,850
With that said, I'll see you in the next section.
