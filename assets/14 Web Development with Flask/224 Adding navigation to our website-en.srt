00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,620
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,290
Something that really bugs me about our application

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,030
is that once you're in a post,

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,720
you can't go back to the homepage

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,920
unless you press the back button.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,820
Similarly, you can't really easily create a new post

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,690
unless you type the URL yourself, /post/create.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,573
And even when you're here,

9
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:22,980
you can't go back to the homepage either.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,050
So it's always a good idea

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,760
to add some proper navigation to your pages

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,490
just so your users and yourself

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,710
can go through them a bit easier.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,270
Let's go over to PyCharm and do this just now.

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm gonna stop the app first of all and minimise that.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,690
And in order to add the links,

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,320
all we have to do is think about where we wanna put them.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,250
Personally, I think that every page

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,270
should have a link to the homepage

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,950
so I'm gonna add the link to the homepage

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,430
inside base on HTML.

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,440
This block content will be replaced

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,420
by the child content every page.

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,070
So if you put something in here,

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,750
it won't be present in any of the pages.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,030
Just because when you have home.jinja2 for example,

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,050
this is going to replace this.

28
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,171
It's not going to add to it.

29
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,820
So if you wanna put something in every page,

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,770
put it outside of the block of content.

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,970
What we're gonna do here is add a URL to the homepage.

32
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,560
And I think you can do this.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,970
Add a new anchor tag, add the href,

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,930
and make it point to the url_for of the homepage.

35
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,763
Try that out.

36
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:31,220
Pause the video and give it a go.

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,730
I'm sure you managed.

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,730
All we have to do is create a new a tag,

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,730
give it an href, url_for, and the homepage in here.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,580
Then close the tag and type in home for example.

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,460
Notice how the href needs these quotation marks around it

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,040
because the href contents

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,560
have to be inside quotation marks for HTML.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,900
This here will be replaced by the URL

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,720
or the endpoint of your home function, this one.

46
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,510
If we run the app now

47
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,990
and we go back to Chrome and we refresh,

48
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,760
we can see that we've lost the blog post first of all,

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,770
but we have this home there.

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,700
If we go into a specific post, that home is still there.

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,710
Something that isn't there though

52
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,870
is the ability to create a new post.

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,430
I think that creating a new post

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,130
should only be in the homepage.

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,010
So let's stop our app, minimise that,

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,870
and go over to the homepage

57
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,980
and down below, add another link.

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,340
Once again, I think you can do this.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,150
Hopefully you got that.

60
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,390
In order to create a new post,

61
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,930
all we have to do is again the same.

62
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,630
So create an a tag which is an anchor tag

63
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,340
and an href, type url_for,

64
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,070
and then here the name of the function

65
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,070
that will give you your create.jinja2,

66
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,700
that's the create function so let's go there.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,300
It doesn't need any arguments.

68
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,580
Any arguments could go here after a comma,

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,680
but it doesn't need any because it doesn't

70
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,520
take any parameters.

71
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,420
That's it.

72
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,140
Tried something too many times and then type create post,

73
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,850
create new post for example,

74
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,560
close the a tag and that's it.

75
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,500
Again, we can run our app,

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,910
go over here, refresh,

77
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,020
and now we can see this create new post thing there.

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,380
We've got a bit of a nicer navigation there

79
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,270
that we can navigate our page

80
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,150
without having to type out the URLs ourselves.

81
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,780
I want you to realise these are just building blocks.

82
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,180
You've got your links.

83
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,530
You've got your p tags, your lists,

84
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,080
and a few things in Flask

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,110
like url_for, redirects, render templates,

86
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,530
the ability to show information,

87
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,760
and there are countless things you can do

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,630
with this knowledge already.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,680
Granted, the website could look a bit nicer.

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,120
You wanna look at CSS for that.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,490
This is not the course for that

92
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,700
because this is not a web course.

93
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,640
But if you want to look at CSS for styling the page,

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,580
make it look a bit nicer,

95
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,360
add some colour, add different font sizes,

96
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,610
maybe not put everything just on the left of the page,

97
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,020
maybe put things centred in the middle

98
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,520
or something like that,

99
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,370
you can learn about that

100
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,930
and it's actually fairly straightforward

101
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,680
to do some simple but nice looking websites.

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
And now with Python, you can do a lot of stuff.

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
You know Python pretty well by now.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,850
You can store things in a database

105
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,910
and do countless other things

106
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,170
in terms of giving the user information

107
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,340
and calculating things.

108
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,104
Hopefully this opens new doors for you

109
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,900
in terms of communicating with your users.

110
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,600
I hope you've enjoyed this section

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,750
and I'm glad to guide you through Flask development.

112
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,300
I'll see you in the next video.
