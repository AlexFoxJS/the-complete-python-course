00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:03,666
Welcome to this section! I'm really excited

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,666
for this section, because it is one of my passions.

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,666
I have a number of other courses on this, and I think you're really going

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,666
to love learning about Flask and web development

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,000
with Python.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,033
In this section

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,033
we're going to be giving users engaging

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,533
content, getting data back from them,

9
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,533
and presenting everything in a nice, easy to use

10
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,533
fashion. Flask is excellent for that.

11
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,533
And Python is a really strong language for doing all

12
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,533
sorts of web development as a whole.

13
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,533
Even from its use of decorators and database interactions,

14
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,533
all the way up to asynchronous development,

15
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,166
Python is a great language to do this sort of stuff.

16
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:44,033
With that said, I'll see you on the next video
