<v ->Welcome to Section Nine.</v>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,140
This section is gonna see us talk about

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,250
some more advanced Python concepts.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,330
We're going to talk about generators,

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,390
which are an essential and awesome Python feature,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,800
unique to Python in many aspects.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,310
We're also then going to cover some functional

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,700
programming concepts and also some of the functions

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,470
that come with Python that are good

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,440
for functional programming.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,990
I'll see you in the next video.
