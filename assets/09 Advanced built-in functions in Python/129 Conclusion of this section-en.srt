<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,960
Generators can sometimes melt your brain

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,010
but hopefully you're still with me.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,270
They're just a way to suspend a function

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,330
and then resume it afterwards.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,000
In addition, we looked at some functional programming

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,930
concepts, like filter and map,

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,590
which have their Python counterparts

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,540
in list comprehensions but can sometimes be really useful

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,680
and sometimes even faster than list comprehension.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,260
Hopefully this section was interesting,

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,910
and I'll see you on the next one.
