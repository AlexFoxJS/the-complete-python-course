<v ->Congratulations on reaching the end of the section.</v>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,260
Errors in Python can be extremely useful

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,390
and I'm sure you've now learned a bunch of stuff

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,890
related to how we use errors, how we create our own errors,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,550
and why we can use errors in Python so well.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,300
Throughout the next few sections

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,350
we'll be using errors precisely for what we've covered,

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,710
to convey information about what happens in our functions.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,640
Let's move onto the next section

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
where we'll be learning some more Python.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,630
I'll see you there.
