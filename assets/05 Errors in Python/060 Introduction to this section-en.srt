00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,580
In section five, we're going to look at something

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,540
that happens often in programming,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,920
but in Python, it's particularly useful, and that's errors.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,500
Errors in Python are often used to modify the flow

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,350
of our programmes and make them do different things.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,680
In addition, Python programmes often use errors

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,060
just as a way of conveying that something happened

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,020
within a function.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,460
It's really unique to Python to use errors in this way.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,500
So we'll look at that throughout this section.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,050
I'll see you in the next video.
