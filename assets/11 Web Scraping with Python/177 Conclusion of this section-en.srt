00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,860
<v ->Congratulations on finishing this section.</v>

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,640
I'm sure scraping web applications

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,040
is now really straightforward

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,230
with the framework we've set out in this section.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,350
It's a pretty unique way of doing things

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,440
but it is very powerful.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,810
Now in the next few sections

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,100
we'll be extending the applications

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,600
we've built here and adding functionality.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,250
So stayed tuned and I'll see you on the next section.
