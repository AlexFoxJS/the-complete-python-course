00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
<v Jose>Hi and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,510
In this video we're going to get the page count

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,040
from the page itself as opposed to hard-coding it to 50.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,040
So instead of 50 we want page.page_count, for example.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,540
Now this is going to be a property of our AllBooksPage

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,720
so let's go into there and add it in.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,362
What we'll want to do is of course have some property here

8
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,430
that says page_count

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:33,290
and it'll return, we're gonna start with 50,

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,400
but of course it's going to return something

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,270
coming from the page.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,610
Let's go over to Chrome and find out what that might be.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,110
Here we have now moved over to Chrome

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,120
where we've got the page,

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,160
and we want to right click and inspect.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,910
This is going to bring us over to the inspector

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,130
and it's gonna highlight the thing we've inspected.

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,730
In this case it's an li, not to interesting.

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,270
If we go down to the very bottom

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,180
and we right click and inspect the 50,

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,130
we will now get something a bit more interesting,

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,770
which is this pager here.

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,210
I'm just gonna expand this

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,730
and notice how the website changes,

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,180
but the HTML is not going change so this is fine.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,820
Then we have a bunch of things in here.

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,470
We have a li, which has a class of current,

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,330
and that contains page one of 50.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,820
In there we have a UL which is a pager.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,700
By the way, I know that I'm scrolled to high up there.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,990
So this is the pager there.

32
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,350
That's inside a div which is inside another div

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,790
which is inside the section.

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,690
So as you can see, fairly similar to where the different

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,510
here, different books are.

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,390
We've got instead of inside that row class,

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,760
we've got a pager.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,700
And inside that pager class, that UL,

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,590
we have a list item, which is the current class

40
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,300
that has the page one of 50.

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,700
So what we're gonna do is extract this class here.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,160
And what we're gonna do is go over to the top

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,514
div page enter,

44
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,562
then we're gonna get the section,

45
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:17,000
then we're gonna get the pager,

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,790
and then we're gonna fi current.

47
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,380
And that's gonna give us the page one of 50.

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,930
So let's go over back to PyCharm and set this up.

49
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,970
Let's open the AllBooksPageLocators

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,430
and here we're going to add a new locator.

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,654
This locator is gonna be the pager locator

52
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:45,654
and it's gonna be div.page_inner section ul.pager li.current

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,100
and that's going to give us that element we just found

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,125
that contains page one of 50.

55
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,870
Going back to the AllBooksPage,

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,765
instead of returning 50, we are going to get

57
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:01,440
the content from that tag.

58
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,022
So we're gonna do content equals

59
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:06,260
self.soup.select_one(AllBooksPageLocators.PAGER).string

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,310
and that's gonna give us page one of 50.

61
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,050
And then we're gonna use regular expressions

62
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,950
to extract the 50.

63
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,060
And I think you can do that looking at the

64
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,130
currency we looked at in the book_parser,

65
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,210
you can do the same thing for page one of 50.

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,910
And what we're interested in this case

67
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,460
is the 50 that comes at the end.

68
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,000
So using the regular expression module,

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,760
the search function inside it, I think you can find it.

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,510
Give this a go and then come back to the video

71
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,070
and we will continue.

72
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,210
I hope you managed.

73
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,960
All that we have to do is of course first of all

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,070
define our pattern, which is going to be

75
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,070
page zero to nine plus of and inside brackets

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,580
zero to nine plus,

77
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,120
because this is gonna be page one

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,120
or page 10 or 20 or whatever of 50 for example.

79
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,940
And inside the brackets, remember,

80
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,481
we're get our group when we do search.

81
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,100
So then we're going to create our matcher,

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,010
which is gonna be re.search of pattern in content.

83
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,110
We have to import re

84
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,679
and another tidbit of Python convention,

85
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,890
when you import a module, I think I have said this earlier,

86
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,484
when you import a module make sure that it's at the top.

87
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,160
Other module imports that you don't

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,580
import from your own code go underneath it

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,600
and finally your own code imports go below that.

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,610
So this style of imports go at the very top.

91
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,230
And then we've got the number of pages which is

92
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,720
an int of matcher.group(1).

93
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,815
Remember matcher.group(0) is going to be

94
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:59,720
the entire page one of 50.

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,210
The first group, group one,

96
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,540
is going to be whatever's inside the brackets.

97
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,300
Now if you have multiple sets of brackets,

98
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,200
that would be then group two and group three and so forth.

99
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:10,890
And that's it.

100
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,650
We then return pages and that will give us

101
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,300
the number of pages in the whole site.

102
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,540
Let's go back to app and instead now

103
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,596
we can see that this has not gone yellow anymore,

104
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,510
which was an error before.

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,830
Now it is page.page_count is seen as a valid.

106
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,300
We can run the menu again.

107
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,150
Let me close that

108
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,630
and we shouldn't get any errors.

109
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:36,360
But it should take awhile.

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,793
And there we have it.

111
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,670
It seems to be loaded.

112
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,261
We can get the best books and can see that they are there.

113
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,280
And so that's pretty awesome.

114
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,930
We have now successfully extracted some more information

115
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,800
from the page.

116
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,014
And as you can see, there's really nothing

117
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:57,860
too magical going on here.

118
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,290
All that we're doing is selecting or finding

119
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,060
the locator that we want to use in your browser

120
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,110
and then just getting it,

121
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,090
or maybe doing some regular expression

122
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,030
to extract something from it.

123
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,200
Regular expressions very powerful.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
Can be a bit confusing,

125
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,770
so I'd recommend you study them

126
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,490
in more depth as you advance your knowledge of programming.

127
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,690
It can be really useful.

128
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,190
But that's it for this video.

129
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,130
I just wanted to show you another example

130
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,520
of extracting some data from the site

131
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,330
and how straighforward it is.

132
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,310
All you're looking for are patterns.

133
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,270
So with that said, I'll see you on the next video.
