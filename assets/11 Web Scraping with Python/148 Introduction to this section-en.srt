<v ->Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,910
I'm really excited to guide you through section 11.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,340
This is one of the most requested pieces of content

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,690
in any of my courses, and it involves scraping the web,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,770
extracting information from websites

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,620
so that you can use them in your Python programmes.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,520
For example, you may want to get all the news headlines

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,880
from the BBC so that you don't have to go to the website

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,280
and try to look through the different pages,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,540
or you could download the scores of the NFL

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,300
so that you don't have to go and look for them.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,360
There are many, many use cases for downloading websites

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,470
and extracting data from them.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,850
And in this section, I'm really excited to present

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,380
to you a unique way of structuring

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,280
your web scraping applications

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,280
that's gonna make it really easy for you to develop them.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,670
I'll see you in the next video.
