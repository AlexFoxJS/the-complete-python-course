00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,470
<v Jose>Hi, welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,190
In this video we're going to be constructing our menu.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,040
It's going to be really straight forward.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,950
What we're going to do is we're gonna give the user

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,940
some choices to make.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,520
And I'm gonna paste in here

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,400
what exactly the choice is gonna be.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,900
So let's say the user has these choices.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,020
They can enter one of the following, the character b,

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,040
to look at five star books, the best books.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,090
C to look at the five cheapest books

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,020
or the ten cheapest books,

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,440
N to just get the next of level book on the collection.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,860
Let's say catalogue here.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,920
And they can type q to exit.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,510
And then they're gonna enter their choice.

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,130
So you know exactly how to do this now.

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,870
You have all the tools you need.

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,480
This one here has not been implemented for you,

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,560
how to get the next available book in the catalogue,

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,870
but I'm sure you can use generators to do this.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,596
So give it a go, try to implement this menu yourself.

23
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:04,080
Allow the user to get cheapest books, five star books,

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,980
the next book, and also run that on a loop so that

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,340
they can always exit the application.

26
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:18,520
I hope you managed, let's get started on creating our menus.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,270
So down here I'm going to create our menu property here.

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,700
And I'm gonna say user input is input of user choice.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
While the user input is not q we're going to run our menu.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,810
So we're gonna say if user input is equal to b,

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,550
we're gonna print the best books.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,510
Elif the user input is equal to c we are gonna print

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,820
the cheapest books.

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,380
Elif the user input is equal to n we're going to somehow

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
get the next book.

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,100
We're gonna implement that in a moment.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,100
Else we're going to print Please choose a valid command.

38
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,680
I think that's a reasonable thing to do.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,680
And finally we're gonna once again give them the choice

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,470
to give us another thing that they want to do.

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,470
Then at the very end we're going to run the menu.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,910
Let's implement the get next book function.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,784
All that we have to do in order to get the next book

44
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:33,030
is create the generator on the books.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,580
And then get next book can just print out the next of that.

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,580
That is how simple it can be using generators.

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,360
You don't have to worry about what was the last book

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
you looked at or keeping an index or something

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,900
of how many books you've gone through.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,760
No, just create a generator for the list.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,800
Very efficient because it doesn't actually do anything

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
until you start getting the next book.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,570
So it doesn't take up any memory or not a lot of memory.

54
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,680
It's not completely free but it's essentially free.

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,640
It doesn't take up any processing power.

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,420
Every time you press next it just gives you the next book

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,850
in that generator.

58
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,200
It doesn't exactly go through the entire list

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,300
or anything like that.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,015
So that's a great way of setting up this

61
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,100
getting the next of something.

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,020
Let's run it and see what happens.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,050
I get to enter one of the following.

64
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,680
Let's type b and then I see sort of the best books

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,520
in here, five star books, four star books.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,620
It's pretty awesome, maybe I wanna buy one of these.

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,850
C, you can look at the cheapest books, just in case

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,850
you are wanting to spend a little less money on a book.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,370
Some of them are not so good, but others are pretty good.

70
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,300
Maybe you can find something good there.

71
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,450
And if you just wanna go through the books,

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,600
just press n, and then you get one, A Light in the Attic

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,515
and again Tipping the Velvet.

74
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,400
It's not a very good one.

75
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:18,890
Soumission I guess that's French, or maybe it's some

76
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,430
sort of weird just submission thing.

77
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,420
And also not very good.

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,380
And that's it.

79
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,480
Now you cannot go back on the catalogue.

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll leave that to you to implement,

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,640
but this is how you can see the different things

82
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,680
that are in the catalogue.

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,130
I guess you could go back just by scrolling up.

84
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,960
That works too.

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
Then you can press q to terminate.

86
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,440
Okay so there are a few more improvements

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,030
we're gonna make on this project.

88
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,080
The first improvement we're gonna make is we are

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,900
going to scrape all of the pages in the catalogue,

90
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,230
not just one.

91
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,190
That way we're gonna get a much larger collection.

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,940
So we're gonna look at how to scrape multiple pages,

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,870
how to go through different pages of this site.

94
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,815
And we can also add logging just so it's easier

95
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,190
to spot when things go wrong and also

96
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,120
what's going on in the programme.

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,720
I'd encourage you to try to do these too.

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,870
Particularly the logging because we've already

99
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
looked at logging.

100
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:12,620
You know it's quite simple.

101
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,700
All you have to do is import logging,

102
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,430
set up the logger, and start logging in different places.

103
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,579
I encourage you to do that and try to set up the

104
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,820
looking at different pages if you can.

105
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,560
But if not, just wait and we will do it here.

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
For the logging, one of the most important things

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,590
about logging and why I'm recommending that you do it

108
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,340
is deciding where to log and what to log.

109
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:42,220
Because you can log at every line and that's gonna

110
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,580
make your code look really ugly.

111
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,470
Or you can log too little and then you're not going

112
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,900
to get enough information.

113
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,740
Definitely keep an eye out for that.

114
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,340
Try to implement the logging yourself.

115
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,200
Then we'll go back in the video and do it here.

116
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,920
Just so you can see how much I would log

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,020
and where I would log.

118
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,260
That's it for this video, so we'll see you on the next one.
