Frequently it can be expensive for these websites if they have a lot of robots using them, because they can't make money (such as from advertising).</p><p>Therefore, often websites will ask you that you don't scrape them. They do this by showing you the pages they don't want you to scrape in a file called robots.txt.</p><p>If you navigate to any popular website, such as <a href="https://google.com/robots.txt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://google.com/robots.txt</a>, you'll see that there is a list of pages that you can and can't scrape.</p><p>Note that robots.txt is not a protection mechanism. It's more of a polite notice. If you ignore it, sites may still have other protection mechanisms in place to prevent your scraper from accessing the website, such as captchas.</p><p>For more information on robots.txt: <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.robotstxt.org/</a></p><p>Happy scraping!</p><p>—Jose and the Teclado team</p></p>
