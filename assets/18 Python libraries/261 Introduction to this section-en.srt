<v ->Welcome to this final section.</v>

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,900
In this section, I just wanted to quickly

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,870
talk you through some of the things you can do with Python

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,580
other than what we've looked at in the course already.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,820
We're going to look at a bunch of libraries

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,360
and frameworks you can use

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,230
to develop all sorts of applications,

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,490
from web development that we've already looked at

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,700
to how to send emails, how to send text messages,

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,850
interacting with other types of databases,

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,720
and much more.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,790
As you know, Python is also very popular

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,300
for machine learning, and artificial intelligence,

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,900
and we'll be mentioning a few of those libraries as well.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,450
I'll see you on the next video.
